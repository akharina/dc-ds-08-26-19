    "## Statistical Inference About Means and Proportions with Two Populations\n",
    "In previous sessions we learnt how to develop interval estimates and conduct hypothesis tests for situations involving a single population mean. We continue our discussion of statistical inference by showing how interval estimates and hypothesis tests can be developed for situations involving two populations when the dif- ference between the two population means or the two population proportions is of prime im- portance.\n",
